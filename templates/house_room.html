  <h3 style ="color:black; text-align:center; background-color:skyblue">A house is typically divided into several rooms, 
    each designed for specific functions. The layout of a 
    house can vary widely depending on culture, region, and individual needs, but here 
    are some common rooms and spaces found in many homes:</h3>


    <h3 style ="color:black; text-align:center; background-color:skyblue">Furniture in a house serves not only a functional purpose
       but also plays a crucial role in defining the aesthetics and atmosphere of 
       each room. The theory behind selecting furniture revolves around understanding
      the balance between form, function, and comfort, while considering the spatial 
      layout, design style, and practical needs of the inhabitants. In the living room,
       for example, the arrangement of a sofa, chairs, and coffee tables creates a socialhub where
      families and guests can gather, while the choice of materials and colors helps set the
      tone for the entire home. Similarly, in the bedroom, furniture such as the bed, dresser,
      and nightstands are not only essential for storage and rest but also contribute to creating a 
      relaxing, personal retreat. The principles of furniture design often consider ergonomics,
      ensuring comfort and usability, while also incorporating elements like symmetry, proportion,
      and contrast to achieve visual harmony. In smaller spaces, multi-functional furniture,
      like sofa beds or fold-out tables, is particularly important for maximizing utility
      without compromising on style. Ultimately, the theory behind furniture design 
      emphasizes the importance of thoughtful selection and arrangement, where each 
      serves a specific purpose while
      contributing to an overall cohesive and inviting environment.</h3>
